        What are side effects in React?
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        Side effects are not predictable because they are actions which are
        performed with the "outside world."
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        Common side effects include: Making a request to an API for data from a
        backend server To interact with browser APIs (that is, to use document
        or window directly) Using unpredictable timing functions like setTimeout
        or setInterval
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
      This is why useEffect exists: to provide a way to handle performing these side effects in what are otherwise pure React components.
      </Typography>
      
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        The useEffect hook is particularly useful for tasks like updating the
        DOM, fetching data from API endpoints, setting up subscriptions or
        timers, etc. Itâ€™s a powerful tool that helps to keep your React
        code clean and easy to understand.
